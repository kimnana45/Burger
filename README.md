# EAT- DA- BURGER!

## Description 
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Technologies Used 
MySQL, Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and customized ORM.
This app follows the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## How It Works 
This is how the page look when it first load.
